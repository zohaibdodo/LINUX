Linux Servers 
Install SNMP
	1. Install the SNMPD service by running the following command:

	2. Once the service is installed, verify that it is set to start at startup by running: 
		○ CentOS 6: 
			§ chkconfig snmpd on
		○ CentOS 7: 
			§ systemctl enable snmpd
Configure SNMP
	1. Make a backup of the original configuration file by running: 
		○ mv /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.orig
	2. Create a new SNMP configuration file by running: 
		○ touch /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
	3. Once you have the string, edit /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf and add the following line:
		○ rocommunity  PRDSRV
		○ syslocation  "KARACHI-IP-PABX"
		○ syscontact  zohaib.ahmed@samba.com.pk & re2.telecard@samba.com.pk
	4. Save the configuration file, and finally start the SNMP service by running: 
		○ CentOS 6: 
			§ service snmpd restart
		○ CentOS 7: 
			§ systemctl restart snmpd
