sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2

Step 1 – Set up the Website Directories
These are the directories holding the site’s data that your website visitors will be accessing. Apache’s document root that is accessible from the internet is usually in the /var/www. Here is where we will create the directories for the individual domains we want to host. In each of the directories, we will add public_html directory to hold the actual website files. The virtual host points to the public_html directory. This gives you flexibility since you can keep crucial website files outside the public_html and only place public files inside.

Next, enter the commands below to create the directories. Always remember to substitute the test domains with your actual domains for subsequent setups:

sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.dev/public_html
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/mydomain.com/public_html

Step 2 – Change Read-Write Permissions
The previous commands created the directory structure but kept the ownership to the root user. We want our non-root user to have full read-write permissions to the directories. We also want the general web to have read permissions.

First, change the ownership to the non-root user by entering the following command:

sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/example.dev/public_html
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/mydomain.com/public_html

The $USER is a variable that takes the credentials of the currently logged-in user. The regular user now has ownership of the public_html. Next, you need to grant read permissions to the general web. The following command allows the permission to all the files in the directory ensuring the web pages are served correctly:

sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www

From running the previous three commands, your website can now serve content. In addition, your user can equally create content to be served in the specific directories. Here you can find more information on Ubuntu permissions.

Step 3 – Create Demo Pages in the Directories for Each Virtual Host
With the directory structure in place, it’s time to do some scripting. We will be using HTML and nano text editor to create some basic web pages. Enter the following command to open nano and create an index.html file in the directory for the first domain:

vim /var/www/example.dev/public_html/index.html

<html>
        <head> 
                <title>Welcome to Example.dev!</title> 
        </head>
        <body>
                <h1>Success! The example.dev virtual host is working!</h1>
        </body>
</html>

vim /var/www/mydomain.com/public_html/index.html

<html>
        <head> 
                <title>Welcome to Mydomain.com!</title> 
        </head>
        <body>
                <h1>Success! The mydomain.com virtual host is working!</h1>
        </body>
</html>
 
Step 4 – Create Virtual Host Files for The Domain Names
Virtual host files contain configurations for each virtual host. They define how a domain name will be served. A new installation of Apache comes with a default virtual host file called 000-default.conf which we can use and adapt to our domains. As you can see, it ends with a .conf extension, which is what Ubuntu expects for configuration files.

Apache configuration files are located in the directory /etc/apache2/sites-available. There we will store our virtual host files. We can copy the default conf file and edit where necessary.

Create the first virtual host file for example.dev domain
Enter the following command to create example.dev.conf from copying the default conf file:

sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.dev.conf
1
sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.dev.conf
Next, open the created file using nano editor with sudo privileges using the following command:

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.dev.conf
1
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.dev.conf
The default conf file looks like the screenshot below. The comments are for guiding you. We can remove them and leave only the clean file with the actual configuration lines:

default configuration
You need to customize this file for your domain name and directory path where you have saved the website files. In addition, we will update and add several directives to the file. It already has a ServerAdmin directive, which contains the email address on which the server administrator will receive emails. It also has a DocumentRoot directive, which points to the directory where you have stored the website files.

We need to add two new directives: ServerName and ServerAlias. ServerName sets the base domain name. It is where you put your domain. ServerAlias defines other names that Apache should match as if they are the base domain name. It allows you to match hosts like the www.

Update the file to look as shown below:

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     
ServerAdmin admin@example.dev     
ServerName example.dev     
ServerAlias www.example.dev     
DocumentRoot /var/www/example.dev/public_html     
ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log     
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined 
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

After that, update your domains and email appropriately. Once done, press CTRL + O and ENTER to save the file. To exit the editor, press CTRL + X.

Create the first virtual host file for mydomain.com domain
We can just copy the virtual host for the first domain and update it where necessary for the second domain. Use the following command to copy the file:

sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.dev.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/mydomain.com.conf

Then, open it in nano editor using the command:

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/mydomain.com.conf

Find the directives and update them appropriately so the file looks like shown below:

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     
ServerAdmin admin@mydomain.com     
ServerName mydomain.com 
ServerAlias www.mydomain.com     
DocumentRoot /var/www/mydomain.com/public_html
ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log     
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined 
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

Once done, save the file and exit the editor.

Step 5 – Enabling the Virtual Host Files
In step four, we created the virtual host files. However, they are not functional until you enable them. Apache has a tool called a2ensite that we will use to enable the virtual hosts.

Enter the following two commands to enable the virtual hosts:

sudo a2ensite example.dev.conf
sudo a2ensite mydomain.com.conf

The output of the above commands is as shown below:

Apache еnable configuration
Next, you should disable the default configuration file, we use the a2dissite Apache tool for disabling sites. Enter the following command:

sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf

As seen from the output, you must restart Apache for the configurations to pick up. Use the following command:

sudo systemctl restart apache2

Then, check the status of Apache using the following command:

sudo systemctl status apache2

The output shows that your server is up and running, and it is able to serve the two websites.

Apache 2 status
Step 6 – Modify Local Hosts with Example Domains
If you had not registered an actual domain but you were instead using test domains, you will have to update your local host files. They need to intercept traffic and direct to your website directory when you navigate to any of the domains set in the virtual host files. Remember this will only work on your local computer. If your local computer runs a Windows Operating System, then follow the instructions for setting up hosts on this link.

If you are on a Mac or Linux machine, the hosts file is located in the /etc directory. We will use a nano editor to open and add our test domains. First, find your VPS IP address by entering the following command:

curl -4 icanhazip.com

Enter the following command to open the file and update with your server’s IP address:

sudo nano /etc/hosts
1
sudo nano /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost
127.0.1.1   ComputerName
your_server_IP example.dev
your_server_IP mydomain.com

Then, save and close the file. Whenever you enter a domain name in your browser, the host file is first checked. If the domain name is found, the traffic is directed to the IP address specified. If not found, the DNS system is used for global redirection. For our test domains, the traffic will be directed to the IP address specified.

Step 7 – Test Your Virtual Hosts
With the domain names set up, you can test whether they are working by checking them in the browser/terminal:

curl http://example.dev

The output should display something like this:
curl example.dev
http://mydomain.com

Apache curl mydomain.com
Congratulations! You have successfully configured two websites to run on one server.

Conclusion
In this guide, you learned how to configure your Apache Server to serve more than one website. If you would like to add more websites, you can do so, by following the steps and setting up virtual hosts. Apache can handle as many domains as you may wish, as long as your server resources can handle them.
